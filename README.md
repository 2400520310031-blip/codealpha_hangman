A simple command-line Hangman game built using Python.
Players try to guess a randomly selected word, one letter at a time, before running out of attempts.

🧠 How the Game Works

The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list (["python", "computer", "program", "science", "hangman"]).

You have 6 chances to guess wrong.

For each correct guess, the letter is revealed in the word.

For each wrong guess, your attempts decrease by one.

The game ends when:

You guess all the letters (🎉 You win!), or

You run out of attempts (💀 Game over).
